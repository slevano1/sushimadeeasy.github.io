			<p>I am Sushant Srikrish. Learning to code is one of many things I enjoy learning. I believe this bootcamp is going to aide in my thorough understanding of how the web works in both the Front-end and Back-end. My hope is that after I complete the Full-Stack program at UC Berkeley -- I will be more than ready to take on most developer roles in the Valley.</p> 
			
			<p>My past experiences have mostly been in the E-commerce industry. I started out my career working at walmart.com. There, I learnt a lot about the fundamentals of HTML. Setting up basic modules inside a CMS tool. I basically learnt HTML just by staring at it, and that was the spark that brought me into the world of coding.</p>
			
			<p>For some reason, majority of the folks working in E-commerce have no idea how a website works. How is it possible to work in E-commerce without knowing the basics? I realized there was a ton of opportunity that other people were not seeing. To bring new creative ways to engage the customer online. This coding bootcamp will help me reach a stage where I can implement such exciting opportunities. I can't wait to get started!</p>
